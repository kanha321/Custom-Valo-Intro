Valorant - Home Screen Customizer

This is a simple script that replaces the HomeScreen video with your custom video. This script can find the Valorant directory automatically, you just need to paste your video file in the same directory as the script.

**WARNING: STAY AWAY FROM "SHITS" FOLDER**


## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Copy and paste your video file in the same directory as the script.

2. Launch Riot Client if update is available then update the game, riot client should be running while script is running.

3. Launch the script if you have only one video then you don't need to do anything, but if you have multiple videos then you need to enter the name of the video file (you can just triple left click on the video file name to select and then double right click to copy and paste it)

4. After that the game will launch automatically with your custom video in the HomeScreen.

5. The script will close automatically after all these shits...

**IF YOUR GAME IS NOT IN SAME FOLDER AS THE RIOT CLIENT THEN YOU NEED TO ENTER THE PATH OF THE GAME DIRECTORY MANUALLY IN `path.txt` FILE**
